# IoT-Sensor-Monitoring-and-Control-System
## objective
Using NodeMCU read value from distance sensor(ultrasonic sensor) and upload it to your cloud(Thingspeak ) and display it on dashboard() in graphical format also adding a button to control the device(turn ON or OFF).



## Introduction
The IoT Sensor Monitoring and Control System is a project that aims to utilize distance sensors to measure the proximity of objects and provide real-time monitoring and control capabilities over the Internet. The system utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enable remote access and management of the sensors and connected devices.

This README.md file provides an overview of the project, its features, requirements, setup instructions, and other essential information.


## Hardware Requirements
Distance Sensor ( Ultrasonic Sensor)
Microcontroller Board ( NodeMCU ESP8266 CP2102)
Internet Connectivity (Wi-Fi)
Power Supply
Cloud  : ThingSpeak
Optional: Actuators ( lights) for control actions



## Usage


Power on the IoT Sensor Monitoring and Control System.
Open the web-based user interface on your computer or mobile device.
The interface will display real-time distance measurements from the sensor and any threshold alerts if configured.
Depending on the application, users can initiate control actions through the web interface, triggering actuators connected to the microcontroller.
